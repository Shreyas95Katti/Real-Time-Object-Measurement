# Real-Time Object Measurement

Greetings!!

This project was chosen for its originality, and I was fortunate to lead a remarkable team of ambitious individuals in its pursuit. The goal is to automate the process of measuring the dimensions of objects in the frame, enhancing industry conditions by making measurement more precise and efficient. I'm delighted to inform you that this project has been launched on the cloud using the Streamlit library.

## Overview

The project incorporates ArUco marker and OpenCV concepts. It can measure square, rectangular, and circular shaped objects. The team is excited to generalize the procedure to measure irregular objects as well. For the product to operate in real time, a standard ArUco marker must be placed in the frame to ensure all measurements are accurate. 

## Modules

1. **Image-Based Measurements**: 
   - Takes measurements from images with the ArUco marker in frame.
   
2. **Real-Time Measurements**: 
   - Uses a simple stereo camera to perform measurements in real time with the ArUco marker as a reference.
   
The "streamlit" file is used to deploy these modules onto the cloud.
